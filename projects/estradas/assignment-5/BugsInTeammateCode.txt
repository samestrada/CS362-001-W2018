BUG 1) There is a bug in the isValid() function within the Appt.java file, in which NumDaysInMonth was hard coded to 31 instead of being calculated by the CalendarUtil class. Since each month differs in days of the month, this would not work to fully validate whether the days of the month given by the user for an appointment (for instance, if the appointment was made for Jan. 31, the function would allow this to be valid). 

BUG 2) In TimeTable.java, there is no check to see is the appointment is recurring in the private function getNextAppt(). This causes the tests to fail when there are non-recurring appointments.
